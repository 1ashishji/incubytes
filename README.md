# Incubytes Employee Portal — Production-Ready (TDD-Based)

A scalable, production-grade employee management system built with **Ruby on Rails 7 (API)** and **React (Vite)**.

Designed with **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, clean architecture, and performance in mind, this system handles **10,000+ records with consistent performance and low query overhead**.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Scalable Performance**: Handles large datasets (10,000+) efficiently using keyset pagination.
- **Reliability First**: Built with a strict TDD workflow to ensure zero-regression and long-term maintainability.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows senior-grade design patterns for clear separation of concerns.
- **Production Mindset**: Fully Dockerized and designed for production-readiness with scalable services and background processing.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Docker)

Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed, then:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to backend
cd backend/

# 2. Build and start services
sudo docker-compose up --build

# 3. Setup database
sudo docker-compose exec web bin/rails db:prepare
```

## 🌐 Access Points
- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **API**: [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/employees](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/employees)

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project demonstrates strong TDD discipline through **20+ incremental commits**, each following a strict logical progression:
1. **Write failing test** ❌ (Define behavior)
2. **Implement minimal code** ✅ (Pass behavior)
3. **Refactor** 🔁 (Optimize & clean)

Each commit represents a single logical step in the application's evolution, ensuring a robust and well-audited codebase.

**Run tests:**
```bash
sudo docker-compose exec web bin/rails test
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🔹 Backend (Rails 7 API)
- **Namespaced API**: `/api/v1` for versioning and client stability.
- **Cursor-based Pagination**: Ensures O(1) database performance at any scale.
- **Service-Based Architecture**: Business logic (like promotions) isolated in `app/services/` for clean code separation.
- **Production-Ready**: Integrated with MySQL 8, Redis, and Sidekiq for high-performance background tasks.

### 🔹 Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Modern UI**: Responsive dashboard with real-time feedback.
- **Toast Notifications**: Professional-grade state management for CRUD actions.
- **Live Tracking**: Accurate record metrics (e.g., "Showing 1–20 of 10,000").

---

## 📊 High-Scale Data Testing

To simulate production-scale usage and verify performance:
```bash
sudo docker-compose exec web bin/rails db:seed
```
- ✅ Generates **10,000+** records.
- ✅ Verified for consistent performance and low query overhead.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**Containers not starting:**
```bash
sudo docker-compose down --remove-orphans
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

**Database connectivity:**
Ensure your `.env` is configured with `host: db` for Docker networking.

---

## ✅ Summary

This project demonstrates:
- **Strong TDD Discipline**: Every feature is backed by a verified test.
- **Scalable Backend Architecture**: Designed to grow with your data.
- **Clean and Maintainable Code**: High readability and modular design.
- **Production-Ready Setup**: One-command deployment via Docker.
